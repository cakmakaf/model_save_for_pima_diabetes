# model_save_for_pima_diabetes

In this project, 

**1-** We simply apply **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** Algorithm and save the model to **model.json** file. 
We saved the model by calling the **save()** function on the model and specifying the filename.

In our case, we demonstrates this by first fitting a model, evaluating it, and saving it to the file **model.h5**.

**2-** The saved model can then be loaded later by calling the **load_model()** function and passing the filename. 

The function returns the model with the same architecture and weights.

In our case, we load the model, summarize the architecture and evaluate it on the same dataset to confirm the weights and architecture are the same.

**3-** Moreoer, we'll use **Decision Tree** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithms for the prediction of diabetic in pregnant women using **R Programming**.

The plots are created while the deployement on **R**.
